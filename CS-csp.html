            <h1 class="title">Candidate Sourcing Platform</h1>
            <p class="tagline">CSP (Candidate Sourcing Platform) is a HR workflow application built for enterprise clients. The purpose is to allow recruiters to quickly post and manage their jobs on multiple job boards, search for potential candidates, and finally reach out and follow up with their most promising candidates.</p>

            <h3 class="col-12"> My Role </h3>
            <p class="tagline"> I led the design of all CSP's main functions: Search, Post, and Candidate Management.</p>
            <p class="tagline"> My work consisted of <span class="emphasis">UX Research</span> (user testing), <span class="emphasis">UX Design</span> (wireframing and prototyping), and <span class="emphasis">UI Design</span> (visual design). </p>

        <section class="row CS-subSection">
            <h3 class="col-12"> Search </h3>
            <p> Search, as the name applies, allows candidates to search across multiple job boards for potential candidates. Our primary goal for this tool is to minimize the time it takes a recruiter to find a suitable candidate from a list of hundreds of thousands. This meant building a seamless filter that allows recruiters to quickly sift through their list.</p>
