            <h1 class="title">Big Data Analytics Suite</h1>
            <p class="tagline">BDAS (Big Data Analytics Suite) is a enterprise level data analytics tool for recruiters and managers to quickly assess the various facets of their workflow. This includes geographical data, university data, job board source data, and many others. Having this data at their fingertips, recruiters will be able to formulate the most effective plan to allocate their resources to land the best candidates.</p>
            <p class="tagline"><span class="emphasis">Clients include:</span> Hilton, PepsiCo, Geico, and Stryker </p>
            <p class="disclaimer">To comply with my non-disclosure agreement, I have omitted and obfuscated confidential information in this case study. The information in this case study is my own and does not necessarily reflect the views of Broadbean.</p>

            <h3 class="col-12"> My Role </h3>
            <p class="tagline"> I worked with our small team of designers to build out numerous reports for BDAS, and many times led the effort of constructing the layout of the reports.</p>
            <p class="tagline"> My work consisted of <span class="emphasis">UX Research</span> (user testing), <span class="emphasis">UX Design</span> (prototyping), and <span class="emphasis">UI Design</span> (visual design). </p>

            <h3 class="col-12"> Filtering </h3>
            <p> BDAS consists of over ten reports showing the different aspects of the clients' business. Each of these reports can be filtered by different criteria, as well as relational filters that depend on previous selections. Thus, the filtering functionality for selecting a report is critical for the client. Our team spent a lot of time coming up with a simplified design to tackle this complex problem that allows the user to quickly select previously chosen filters/reports, as well as save their most used. New reports can be run by manually selecting filters based on their needs.</p>

            <h3 class="col-12"> Data Reports </h3>
            <p> BDAS consists of over ten reports showing the different aspects of the clients' business. Each of these reports serve a different purpose. I've outlined just a few here. Feel free to contact me for more examples.</p>
            <br />
            <p> <span class="emphasis">Summary of Inidividual Placed Job:</span> The purpose of this report is to give the user a deep look at a specific job that has already been placed. At a glance, the user is able to see how long it took, how much it cost, and the most efficient job boards that they used. </p>
            <img class"img-fluid" src="./images/BDAS-PlacedJob.png" />
            <br />
            <p> <span class="emphasis">Summary of Open Jobs:</span> Users pull up this report to investigate which jobs are still open and not yet filled, then drill down a bit deeper to a particular open job. At a glance, the user is able to see how many jobs are currently open, what their current pipline of candidates looks like, and how much they're spending on these open jobs.</p>
            <img class"img-fluid" src="./images/BDAS-SummaryOpen.png" />
            <br />
            <p> <span class="emphasis">Summary of Inidividual Open Job:</span> Following the Summary of Open Jobs report, users will be able to choose a certain open job and investigate why exactly that job is still open. They'll be able to determine how many jobs have been placed in the last year, current pipeline of candidates, total cost, as well as additional information to help them find a placement.</p>
            <img class"img-fluid" src="./images/BDAS-IndividualOpen.png" />
            <br />
            <p> <span class="emphasis">Aging Jobs:</span> This report allows the user to get a bird's eye view of jobs that have been aging and have not yet been filled. The main purpose is to give hiring managers an overall look at all the jobs their team is responsible for, and figure out which jobs are the lowest performers in order to determine a proper course of action.</p>

            <h3 class="col-12"> Candidate Timeline </h3>
            <p> A recruiter's job revolves around finding a candidate for a specified job. As you can imagine, getting a detailed view into the progress of their chosen candidate is crucial for a recruiter to efficiently place that candidate. We designed a timeline feature for each candidate within the recruiter's pipeline that gives a overview of the candidate, as well as any progress the candidate has made for a particular job. </p>

            <h3 class="col-12"> Results </h3>
            <p> BDAS has transformed the recruiting industry and given recruiters a much more in-depth look at their business. With over 500,000 live recruiters using our platform, they now have a clearer look at where they need to market, and where to look for the best potential candidates. As a result, jobs are now filled faster and cheaper than before.</p>

        <section class="row CS-subSection">
            <h3 class="col-12"> Ongoing Work </h3>
            <p> New reports are constantly being introduced for BDAS. The dialogue between us and recruiters will result in new data that needs to be shown. The next report that is currently being produced will help the recruiter look at university statistics, so they know which university is most efficient for their marketing dollars.</p>
